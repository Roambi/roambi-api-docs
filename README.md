# Roambi API Documentation

Roambi provides a RESTful API for programmatic access to your data in the Roambi
Library, which is a remote file system (RFS) that is hosted by Roambi Business.
This API uses the JSON format for data and OAuth for Authorization and Authentication.

All aspects of Roambi API are modeled as structured objects. These objects and
structures were designed to be intuitive and simple to use. For example, a "folder"
object represents a storage destination, a "user" object has associated "roles"
and "access level", and a collection of "files" can be used to determine the
content of the "folder".

The Roambi SDK provides a set of JAVA client libraries that help you develop apps
to integrate with Roambi via Roambi API.
