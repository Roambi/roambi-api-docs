# Getting Started With the Roambi API

This guide will help you get started as quickly as possible with the Roambi API.  Once you have gotten familiar with the API by following the steps in this guide, see the 'api-resources' section for details about how to write your own custom applications for Roambi Business.

## Setting up your workspace

One of the simplest way to access the API is to use curl.  OSX / Linux users should already have this tool installed; Windows users can download and install from this page:  http://curl.haxx.se/download.html

The basic steps to start working with the API are:
1.  Set up an API Client in the Roambi Business administration web application
2.  Authenticate against the API using the configuration properties for your API Client
3.  Use the resulting authentication token to issue requests against to the API


### 1.  Set up an API Client
