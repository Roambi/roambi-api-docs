{
"resources": {
    "uid": "1d357230-23ee-4d3...",
    "name": "Joan Harris",
    "given_name": "Joan",
    "family_name": "Harris",
    "image_url": null,
    "default_image_url": "http://roambi.com/user.png",
    "primary_email": "joan@scdp.com",
    "accounts": [{
      "uid": "218ace6d-d0f8-4466-9a...",
      "product": "Business"
    }]
  }
}
```


Note: This endpoint is used to collect the User Account uid (i.e. $ACCOUNT_UID). The uid is stored under *resources.accounts[0].uid*, so, for this specific example, the value is "218ace6d-d0f8-4466-9a..."
